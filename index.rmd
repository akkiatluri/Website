## Filtering Columns and Rows

when using dplyr, you can filter columns and rows by using select and filter. Let's look at an example using the Lahman baseball databse. we first have to load the Lahmna and dplyr packages


```{r message =FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
```

now , suppose we would like to see the homerun totals for the 1927 new york yankees. we could run the following code

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
filter(teamID=="NYA" & yearID==1927)

```
